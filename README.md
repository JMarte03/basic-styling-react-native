## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** JavaScript, React Native, Expo

This project uses React Native to build a mobile app with a focus on component-based development. The app incorporates:

- **React Native Components** like `View`, `Text`, `Image`, and `TouchableOpacity`.
- **Custom Components** created to enhance app modularity and reusability.
- **Styling** using React Native’s `StyleSheet` for a consistent and flexible UI.
- **Deep Linking** to handle navigation between different screens directly from external sources.
- **Touchable Features** to provide interactive elements through `TouchableOpacity`.

Here’s an example of the various UI cards and interactions in the app:

## Optimizations

One optimization that could be implemented in future iterations is performance improvement by lazy-loading images or applying memoization techniques to prevent unnecessary re-renders.

## Lessons Learned:

Building this app gave me a deeper understanding of React Native’s component lifecycle and how to manage state effectively in a mobile context. I also learned how to implement and debug deep linking, which was a new challenge for me in the development process.

This should be a good foundation for your README. You can tweak it further or add the actual project links once you're ready! Let me know if you'd like to make more changes.
