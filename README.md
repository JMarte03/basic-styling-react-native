## 💻 How It's Made:

Tech used: JavaScript, TypeScript, React Native

This project uses React Native to build a mobile app with a focus on component-based development. The app incorporates:

- **React Native Components** like `View`, `Text`, `Image`, and `TouchableOpacity`.
- **Custom Components** created to enhance app modularity and reusability.
- **Styling** using React Native’s `StyleSheet` for a consistent and flexible UI.
- **Deep Linking** to handle navigation between different screens directly from external sources.
- **Touchable Features** to provide interactive elements through `TouchableOpacity`.

Here’s an example of the various UI cards and interactions in the app:

## 🧠 Lessons Learned:

Building this app gave me a deeper understanding of React Native’s component lifecycle and how to manage state effectively in a mobile context. I also learned how to implement and debug deep linking, which was a new challenge for me in the development process.
